## Dungen Escape (or Maze Game)

### Overview
**Dungen Escape** (or **Maze Game**) is an exciting and challenging maze adventure where your goal is to escape from a labyrinth. Along the way, you’ll need to find a **key ('&')** to open the **treasure ('X')**, collect **coins ('C')**, and navigate around **walls ('#')** and **teleporters ('%')**. The game is designed to test your decision-making, problem-solving, and navigation skills as you advance through progressively harder levels.

### Gameplay
- **Maze Navigation**: The game is set in a labyrinth full of obstacles, puzzles, and rewards. Your hero needs to navigate through the maze, searching for important items while avoiding traps and dangers. 
- **Key and Treasure**: To complete each level, you must locate the **key ('&')** hidden somewhere in the maze, which is required to unlock the **treasure ('X')** and advance to the next level.
- **Coins**: Along the way, you will find **coins ('C')** scattered throughout the maze. Collecting these coins can help you unlock additional features or provide extra points to your profile.
- **Teleports**: Some paths are blocked, but you'll find **teleports ('%')** scattered around the maze. Stepping on a teleport will instantly move you to another part of the maze, allowing you to bypass certain obstacles. 
- **Walls**: Be careful to avoid **walls ('#')**, as they block your progress and may force you to find another route.
